Usually, when working on HPC systems, you compile your application against the MPI libraries provided on the system
or you use applications that have been compiled by the HPC system support team. This approach to portability:
*source code portability* is the traditional approach to making applications portable to different HPC platforms.

However, compiling complex HPC applications that have lots of dependencies (including MPI) is not always straightforward
and can be a significant challenge as most HPC systems differ in various ways in terms of OS and base software
available. There are a number of different approaches that can be taken to make it easier to deploy applications
on HPC systems; for example, the [Spack](https://spack.readthedocs.io) software automates the dependency resolution and compilation of
applications. Containers provide another potential way to resolve these problems but care needs to be taken 
when interfacing with MPI on the host system which adds more complexity to running containers in parallel on
HPC systems.

### MPI codes with Singularity containers

Obviously, we will not have admin/root access on the HPC platform we are using so cannot (usually) build our container 
images on the HPC system itself. However, we do need to ensure our container is using the MPI library on
the HPC system itself so we can get the performance benefit of the HPC interconnect. How do we overcome these 
contradictions?

The answer is that we install a version of the MPI library in our container image that is binary compatible with 
the MPI library on the host system and install our software in the container image using the local version of
the MPI library. At runtime, we then ensure that the MPI library from the host is used within the running container
rather than the locally-installed version of MPI.

There are two widely used open source MPI library distributions on HPC systems:

* [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/) - in addition to the open source version, MPICH is [binary compatible](https://www.mpich.org/abi/) with many
  proprietary vendor libraries, including Intel MPI and HPE Cray MPT as well as the open source MVAPICH.
* [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/)

This typically means that if you want to distribute HPC software that uses MPI within a container image you will 
need to maintain versions that are compatible with both MPICH and OpenMPI. There are efforts underway to provide
tools that will provide a binary interface between different MPI implementations, e.g. HPE Cray's MPIxlate software
but these are not generally available yet. 

### Building a Singularity container image with MPI software

This example makes the assumption that you'll be building a container image on a local platform and then deploying
it to a HPC system with a different but compatible MPI implementation using a combination of the *Hybrid* and *Bind*
models from the Singularity documentation. We will build our application using MPI in the container image but will
bind the MPI library from the host into the container at runtime. See
[Singularity and MPI applications](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide/mpi.html)
in the Singularity documentation for more technical details.

The example we will build will:
* Use MPICH as the container image's MPI library
* Use the Ohio State University MPI Micro-benchmarks as the example application
* Use ARCHER2 as the runtime platform - this uses Cray MPT as the host MPI library and the HPE Cray Slingshot interconnect

The Dockerfile to install MPICH and the OSU micro-benchmark we will use
to build the container image is shown below. Create a new directory called
`osu-benchmarks` to hold the build context for this new image. Create the
`Dockerfile` in this directory.

A quick overview of what the above definition file is doing:

 - The image is being built based on the `ubuntu:20.04` Docker image.
 - In the `RUN` sections:
   - Ubuntu's `apt-get` package manager is used to update the package directory and then install the compilers and other libraries required for the MPICH and OSU benchmark build.
   - The MPICH software is downloaded, extracted, configured, built and installed. Note the use of the `--with-device` option to configure MPICH to use the correct driver to support improved communication performance on a high performance cluster. After the install is complete we delete the files that are no longer needed.
   - The OSU Micro-Benchmarks software is downloaded, extracted, configured, built and installed. After the install is complete we delete the files that are no longer needed.
 - In the `ENV` sections: Set environment variables that will be available within all containers run from the generated image.

### Running Singularity containers with MPI on HPC system

Assuming the above tests worked, we can now try undertaking a parallel run of one of the
OSU benchmarking tools within our container image on the remote HPC platform.

This is where things get interesting and we will begin by looking at how Singularity
containers are run within an MPI environment.

If you're familiar with running MPI codes, you'll know that you use `mpirun` (as we did 
in the previous example), `mpiexec`, `srun` or a similar MPI executable to start your
application. This executable may be run directly on the local system or cluster platform
that you're using, or you may need to run it through a job script submitted to a job
scheduler. Your MPI-based application code, which will be linked against the MPI libraries,
will make MPI API calls into these MPI libraries which in turn talk to the MPI daemon
process running on the host system. This daemon process handles the communication between
MPI processes, including talking to the daemons on other nodes to exchange information
between processes running on different machines, as necessary.

When running code within a Singularity container, we don't use the MPI executables stored
within the container, i.e. we DO NOT run:

`singularity exec mpirun -np <numprocs> /path/to/my/executable`

Instead we use the MPI installation on the host system to run Singularity and start an
instance of our executable from within a container for each MPI process. Without Singularity
support in an MPI implementation, this results in starting a separate Singularity container
instance within each process. This can present some overhead if a large number of processes
are being run on a host. Where Singularity support is built into an MPI implementation
this can address this potential issue and reduce the overhead of running code from within a
container as part of an MPI job.

Ultimately, this means that our running MPI code is linking to the MPI libraries from the MPI
install within our container and these are, in turn, communicating with the MPI daemon on the
host system which is part of the host system's MPI installation. In the case of MPICH, these
two installations of MPI may be different but as long as there is
[ABI compatibility](https://wiki.mpich.org/mpich/index.php/ABI_Compatibility_Initiative) between
the version of MPI installed in your container image and the version on the host system, your
job should run successfully.

We can now try running a 2-process MPI run of a point to point benchmark `osu_latency` on
ARCHER2.

> ## Undertake a parallel run of the `osu_latency` benchmark (general example)
> 
> Create a job submission script called `submit.slurm` on the /work file system on ARCHER2 to run
> containers based on the container image across two nodes on ARCHER2. The example below uses the
> osu-benchmarks container image that is already available on ARCHER2 but you can easily modify it
> to use your version of the container image if you wish - the results should be the same in both
> cases.

This has demonstrated that we can successfully run a parallel MPI executable from within a Singularity container.

### Summary

Singularity can be combined with MPI to create portable containers that run software in parallel across multiple
compute nodes. However, there are some limitations, specifically:

- You must use an MPI library in the container that is binary compatible with the MPI library on the host system - 
  typically, your container will be based on either MPICH or OpenMPI.
- The host setup to enable MPI typically requires binding a large number of low-level libraries into the running 
  container. You will usually require help from the HPC system support team to get the correct bind options for
  the platform you are using.
- Performance of containers+MPI can be substantially lower than the performance of native applications using MPI
  on the system. The effect is dependent on the MPI routines used in your application, message sizes and the number of MPI 
  processes used.
