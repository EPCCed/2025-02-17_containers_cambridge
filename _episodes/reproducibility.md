Although this workshop is titled "Reproducible computational environments using containers",
so far we have mostly covered the mechanics of using Singularity with only passing reference to
the reproducibility aspects. In this section, we discuss these aspects in more detail.

## Reproducibility

By *reproducibility* here we mean the ability of someone else (or your future self) being able to reproduce
what you did computationally at a particular time (be this in research, analysis or something else)
as closely as possible even if they do not have access to exactly the same hardware resources
that you had when you did the original work.

Some examples of why containers are an attractive technology to help with reproducibility include:

  - The same computational work can be run across multiple different technologies seamlessly (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux).
  - You can save the exact process that you used for your computational work (rather than relying on potentially incomplete notes).
  - You can save the exact versions of software and their dependencies in the container image.
  - You can access legacy versions of software and underlying dependencies which may not be generally available any more.
  - Depending on their size, you can also potentially store a copy of key data within the container image.
  - You can archive and share the container image as well as associating a persistent identifier with a container image
    to allow other researchers to reproduce and build on your work.

## Sharing images

We have made use of a few different online repositories during this course, such as [Sylabs Cloud Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) which provide platforms for sharing container images publicly. Once you have uploaded a container image, you can point people to its public location and they can download and build upon it.

This is fine for working collaboratively with container images on a day-to-day basis but these repositories are not a good option for long time archive of container images in support of research and publications as:

  - free accounts have a limit on how long a container image will be hosted if it is not updated
  - it does not support adding persistent identifiers to container images
  - it is easy to overwrite container images with newer versions by mistake.

## Archiving and persistently identifying container images using Zenodo

When you publish your work or make it publicly available in some way it is good practice to make container images that you used for computational work available in an immutable, persistent way and to have an identifier that allows people to cite and give you credit for the work you have done. [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is one service that provides this functionality.

Zenodo supports the upload of *zip* archives and we can capture our Singularity container images as zip archives. For example, to convert the container image we created earlier, `alpine-sum.sif` in this lesson to a zip archive (on the command line):

~~~
zip alpine-sum.zip alpine-sum.sif
~~~
{: .bash}

Note: These zip container images can become quite large and Zenodo supports uploads up to 50GB. If your container image is too large, you may need to look at other options to archive them or work to reduce the size of the container images.

Once you have your archive, you can [deposit it on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/deposit/) and this will:

   - Create a long-term archive snapshot of your Singularity container image which people (including your future self) can download and reuse or reproduce your work.
   - Create a persistent DOI (*Digital Object Identifier*) that you can cite in any publications or outputs to enable reproducibility and recognition of your work.

In addition to the archive file itself, the deposit process will ask you to provide some basic metadata to classify the container image and the associated work.

Note that Zenodo is not the only option for archiving and generating persistent DOIs for container images. There are other services out there -- for example, some organizations may provide their own, equivalent, service.

## Reproducibility good practice

   - Make use of container images to capture the computational environment required for your work.
   - Decide on the appropriate granularity for the container images you will use for your computational work -- this will be different for each project/area. Take note of accepted practice from contemporary work in the same area. What are the right building blocks for individual container images in your work?
   - Document what you have done and why -- this can be put in comments in the Singularity recipe file and the use of the container image described in associated documentation and/or publications. Make sure that references are made in both directions so that the container image and the documentation are appropriately linked.
   - When you publish work (in whatever way) use an archiving and DOI service such as Zenodo to make sure your container image is captured as it was used for the work and that is obtains a persistent DOI to allow it to be cited and referenced properly.

## Container Granularity

As mentioned above, one of the decisions you may need to make when containerising your research workflows
is what level of *granularity* you wish to employ. The two extremes of this decision could be characterized
as:

  - Create a single container image with all the tools you require for your research or analysis workflow
  - Create many container images each running a single command (or step) of the workflow and use them together

Of course, many real applications will sit somewhere between these two extremes.
